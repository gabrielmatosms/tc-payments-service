Using **FastAPI** with a **hexagonal architecture**, the application allows customers to place and track orders and allows administrators to manage products, customers, and orders. It’s built as a monolithic application with a **PostgreSQL** database, containerized for easy deployment using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.
